## Key Features

- Natural language processing of customer requests
- Service level-based permission system
- Smart home device management
- Conversation history tracking
- Intelligent request analysis and response generation
- Support for device relocation requests
- Real-time communication via WebSockets

## Target Users

- Customers with smart home devices at different service tiers:
  - Basic tier customers
  - Premium tier customers
  - Enterprise tier customers
- Customer service representatives
- System administrators

## Business Goals

1. Provide automated customer service for smart home device users
2. Reduce human support costs through AI-powered assistance
3. Offer tiered service levels to encourage upgrades
4. Improve customer satisfaction through quick, accurate responses
5. Gather data on common customer requests and issues

## Success Metrics
