# WebSocket to REST API Migration Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the migration from WebSocket-based communication to REST API for the Agentic Service Bot project. The migration was performed to simplify the architecture, improve reliability, and enhance maintainability.

## Motivation

While WebSockets provide real-time communication capabilities, they also introduce complexity in terms of connection management, error handling, and deployment. The decision to migrate to REST API was based on the following considerations:

1. **Simplicity**: REST APIs are simpler to implement, test, and maintain
2. **Reliability**: No need to handle connection state, reconnection logic, or dropped connections
3. **Compatibility**: Better compatibility with various clients, proxies, and network environments
4. **Scalability**: Easier to scale using standard AWS services
5. **Development Experience**: Simpler debugging and testing process

## Key Changes

### Backend Changes

1. **Removed WebSocket API Gateway**: Replaced with REST API Gateway
2. **Removed WebSocket Handler**: Replaced with REST API handlers
3. **Removed Connection Management**: No need to track WebSocket connections
4. **Simplified Lambda Functions**: Focused on request/response handling
5. **Updated DynamoDB Schema**: Removed connection-related tables and fields

### Frontend Changes

1. **Removed WebSocket Client**: Replaced with REST API service
2. **Removed Connection Status Component**: No longer needed
3. **Updated Chat Component**: Now uses REST API for sending messages and fetching history
4. **Added Polling Mechanism**: For checking new messages
5. **Simplified Error Handling**: More straightforward error handling for HTTP requests

## API Endpoints

The following REST API endpoints replace the WebSocket functionality:

- **POST /api/chat**: Send a chat message to the bot
  - Request: `{ "customerId": "string", "message": "string" }`
  - Response: `{ "message": "string", "timestamp": "string", "messageId": "string", "conversationId": "string" }`

- **GET /api/chat/history/{customerId}**: Get chat history for a customer
  - Response: `{ "messages": [{ "id": "string", "text": "string", "sender": "string", "timestamp": "string", "conversationId": "string" }], "customerId": "string" }`

## Migration Steps

1. **Infrastructure Updates**:
   - Updated CDK stack to remove WebSocket API and add REST API endpoints
   - Removed WebSocket-specific IAM permissions
   - Updated Lambda function configuration

2. **Backend Code Updates**:
   - Removed WebSocket handler and service
   - Added REST API handlers for chat and history endpoints
   - Updated DynamoDB service to remove connection-related functions

3. **Frontend Code Updates**:
   - Removed WebSocket client and connection status component
   - Updated Chat component to use REST API
   - Added polling mechanism for checking new messages
   - Updated types and interfaces

4. **Testing**:
   - Created new test scripts for REST API endpoints
   - Verified functionality with manual testing
   - Ensured backward compatibility for existing data

## Benefits Realized

1. **Simplified Architecture**: Fewer components and dependencies
2. **Improved Reliability**: No connection state to manage
3. **Better Developer Experience**: Easier to debug and test
4. **Enhanced Maintainability**: More straightforward code structure
5. **Reduced Costs**: Lower AWS resource usage

## Potential Drawbacks and Mitigations

1. **Real-time Updates**:
   - **Drawback**: REST APIs don't provide real-time updates like WebSockets
   - **Mitigation**: Implemented polling mechanism to check for new messages

2. **Increased Request Volume**:
   - **Drawback**: Polling increases the number of API requests
   - **Mitigation**: Implemented reasonable polling intervals and caching

3. **Latency**:
   - **Drawback**: Slightly increased latency compared to WebSockets
   - **Mitigation**: Optimized API response times and client-side rendering

## Conclusion

The migration from WebSocket to REST API has successfully simplified the architecture while maintaining all the required functionality. The new implementation is more reliable, easier to maintain, and provides a better developer experience.
