| [Architecture](specs/architecture.md) | System architecture, including components, data flow, and deployment |
| [Service Levels](specs/service-levels.md) | Service tier definitions, permissions, and action definitions |
| [AI Integration](specs/ai-integration.md) | Integration with Claude AI, including prompts, error handling, and performance considerations |
| [Data Model](specs/data-model.md) | Database schema, data structures, relationships, and access patterns |
| [Frontend](specs/frontend.md) | User interface components, pages, WebSocket communication, and user experience |
| [Deployment](specs/deployment.md) | Deployment process, environments, CI/CD pipeline, and monitoring |
| [Testing](specs/testing.md) | Testing strategy, methodologies, automation, and reporting |

## Key Components

The Agentic Service Bot consists of the following key components:

1. **Frontend Application**
   - React-based web interface
   - Real-time WebSocket communication
   - Customer selection and chat interface

2. **Backend Services**

   - WebSocket API Gateway for real-time communication
   - DynamoDB for data storage
   - Claude AI integration for natural language processing

3. **Data Storage**
   - Customers table
   - Service levels table
   - Messages table
   - Connections table

4. **AI Integration**
   - Claude 3 Opus model
   - Request analysis

   - Multi-room audio
   - Custom actions
   - Maximum of 10 devices

## Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**
   - Set up local environment
   - Develop and test features
   - Run unit and integration tests

2. **Continuous Integration**
   - Automated testing on pull requests
   - Code quality checks
   - Build verification

3. **Deployment**
   - Deploy to development environment
   - Verify functionality
   - Deploy to production

## Getting Started

To get started with the project:

1. Review the [Overview](specs/overview.md) document for a high-level understanding
2. Explore the [Architecture](specs/architecture.md) to understand the system design
3. Refer to specific specification documents for detailed information on each aspect of the system

## Maintenance and Updates

The specification documents should be updated when:

1. New features are added
2. Existing features are modified
3. Architecture changes are made
4. Dependencies are updated
5. Deployment processes change

Updates to specifications should follow the same review process as code changes, with pull requests and approvals.
