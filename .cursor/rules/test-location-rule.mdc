      ## Test Location Rule

      All test files must be placed in the `tests` directory, following the structure defined in `tests/README.md`.

      ### Directory Structure

      ```
      tests/
      └── e2e/                  # End-to-end tests for complete workflows
      ```

      ### Testing Rules

      1. **All test files must be placed in the `tests` directory**
         - No test files should be created in the main application directories
         - This ensures consistent test discovery and organization

      2. **Test file naming**
         - All test files must be named with the prefix `test_`
         - Example: `test_user_workflow.py`

      3. **Test organization**
         - End-to-end tests go in the `e2e/` directory
         - Additional test categories can be added as the project evolves

      ### Please move this test file to the appropriate location in the tests directory.

      # File: lambda/api/test_api.py
      import unittest
      
      def test_api_endpoint():
          # Test implementation
          assert True
    output: |
      # This file should be moved to tests/e2e/test_api.py
      import unittest
      
      def test_api_endpoint():
          # Test implementation
          assert True
  
  - input: |
      # File: test_main.py
      import pytest
      
      def test_main_function():
          # Test implementation
          assert True
    output: |
      # This file should be moved to tests/e2e/test_main.py
      import pytest
      
      def test_main_function():
          # Test implementation
          assert True
